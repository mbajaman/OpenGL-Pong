# OpenGL-Pong

This project shows off features of a game that are implemented in C++, Objective C, OpenGL, Box2D and Swift.

## Features
- A ball that bounces off paddles and walls in a randomized direction within a specified range of angles
- The score system if the ball gets behind the paddles increases specified side's points by one
- Moving either the paddles left and right

## Controls
- Tap once to start the game (launches ball in a random direction)
- Pan left or right on the bottom half of the screen to move Player 2
- Pan left or right on the top half of the paddle to move Player 1

**Note: When attempting to move the paddle in the opposite direction the player must lift their finger off of the screen.**
